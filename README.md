# QA Mistral task


## Project description

In this project, we were asked to write a test plan and test cases for web application with multiple-step registration flow and payment system. We were also provided with according wireframes. The project/task itself contains two files:

- Test-Plan
- Test-Cases

In the Test-Plan file we have the following structure:
- brief description
- list of features and their brief explanation
- list of test objectives where we describe what we want to achieve and test with this process
- list of deliverables, which is separated into three sections: before, during, and after the testing
- description of how will we report bugs
- list of tools that we will be using
- list of questions and things to discuss regarding the way the product works (list of things to discuss with Product Owners, Project Managers, Deliver Managers, etc.)

In the Test-Cases file we will list test cases in which each of them will be:
- described thoroughly
- separated by features
- focused on positive and negative flows
- steps needed to execute them
- expected results
- and all written using gherkin syntax 

## Using the project

Because this isn't a typical Full stack project or automation project there is no classical way of using/executing/running the project. Also, this readme.md file only serves the purpose of giving a high-level overview of the things that have been done in those two files mentioned above.
